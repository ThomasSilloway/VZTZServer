Follow instructions on https://docs.eqemu.io/server/installation/server-installation-linux/

The correct install.sh is on the cybernine186/Server/ repo

update the install.sh to use `make -j 4` if using 4 cores

cd to /home/eqemu/server 

Create eqemu_server_skip_update.txt
Edit eqemu_server.pl to point to the Code repo
Run  sudo perl eqemu_server.pl new_server to download DB

If zone error, manually compile the zone executable 

 - Tried compiling with `EQEMU_BUILD_SERVER` as an arg for make - also make sure make uses -j 4
 
 Original issue - eqemu_config had legacy mode turned on, which was the cause of not getting past character select

Fix 1 - add sql fields for pvp
Fix 2 - Run 0.0.0.1.sql

Current issue - Can't run forward or backwards, no npcs, extra races


Ideas:

Could try

I think after the initial install, we set up our own github repo in the folder it installed into or maybe in a home directory and have a script that pulls latest & copies it over

The client for rof2 was on an eqemulator forum post - maybe included in code folder?
